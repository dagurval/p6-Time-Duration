README for Time::Duration
=========================

NAME
----
Time::Duration -- rounded or exact English expression of durations

SYNOPSIS
--------
Example use in a program that ends by noting its runtime:

      my $start_time = time;
      use Time::Duration;
      
      # then things that take all that time, and then ends:
      print "Runtime: ", duration(time - $start_time), ".\n";

Example use in a program that reports age of a file:

      use Time::Duration;
      my $file = 'that_file';
      my $age = SomeModule::get_modtime($file);
      print "$file was modified ", ago($age);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a Perl6 port of Time::Duration module for Perl 5.

This module provides functions for expressing durations in rounded
or exact terms.

In the first example in the Synopsis, using
    duration($interval_seconds):

If the `time - $start_time' is 3 seconds, this prints "Runtime:
3 seconds.". If it's 0 seconds, it's "Runtime: 0 seconds.". If
it's 1 second, it's "Runtime: 1 second.". If it's 125 seconds, you
get "Runtime: 2 minutes and 5 seconds.". If it's 3820 seconds
(which is exactly 1h, 3m, 40s), you get it rounded to fit within
two expressed units: "Runtime: 1 hour and 4 minutes.". Using
duration_exact instead would return "Runtime: 1 hour, 3 minutes,
and 40 seconds".

In the second example in the Synopsis, using
    ago($interval_seconds):

If the $age is 3 seconds, this prints "*file* was modified 3
seconds ago".  If it's 0 seconds, it's "*file* was modified just
now", as a special case.  If it's 1 second, it's "from 1 second
ago". If it's 125 seconds, you get "*file* was modified 2 minutes
and 5 seconds ago". If it's 3820 seconds (which is exactly 1h, 3m,
40s), you get it rounded to fit within two expressed units:
"*file* was modified 1 hour and 4 minutes ago". Using ago_exact
instead would return "*file* was modified 1 hour, 3 minutes, and
40 seconds ago". And if the file's modtime is, surprisingly, three
seconds into the future, $age is -3, and you'll get the equally
and appropriately surprising "*file* was modified 3 seconds from
now."

FUNCTIONS
---------
This module provides all the following functions, which are all
exported by default when you call `use Time::Duration;'.

    duration($seconds)
    duration($seconds, $precision)
Returns English text expressing the approximate time duration
of abs($seconds), with at most `$precision || 2' expressed
units. (That is, duration($seconds) is the same as
duration($seconds,2).)

For example, duration(120) or duration(-120) is "2
minutes". And duration(0) is "0 seconds".

The precision figure means that no more than that many units
will be used in expressing the time duration. For example,
31,629,659 seconds is a duration of *exactly* 1 year, 1 day, 2
hours, and 59 seconds (assuming 1 year = exactly 365 days, as
we do assume in this module). However, if you wanted an
approximation of this to at most two expressed (i.e., nonzero)
units, it would round it and truncate it to "1 year and 1
day".  Max of 3 expressed units would get you "1 year, 1 day,
and 2 hours". Max of 4 expressed units would get you "1 year,
1 day, 2 hours, and 59 seconds", which happens to be exactly
true. Max of 5 (or more) expressed units would get you the
same, since there are only four nonzero units possible in for
that duration.

    duration_exact($seconds)
Same as duration($seconds), except that the returned value is
an exact (unrounded) expression of $seconds. For example,
duration_exact(31629659) returns "1 year, 1 day, 2 hours, and
59 seconds later", which is *exactly* true.

    ago($seconds)
    ago($seconds, $precision)
For a positive value of seconds, this prints the same as
`duration($seconds, [$precision]) . ' ago''. For example,
ago(120) is "2 minutes ago". For a negative value of seconds,
this prints the same as `duration($seconds, [$precision]) . '
from now''. For example, ago(-120) is "2 minutes from now". As
a special case, ago(0) returns "right now".

    ago_exact($seconds)
Same as ago($seconds), except that the returned value is an
exact (unrounded) expression of $seconds.

    from_now($seconds)
    from_now($seconds, $precision)
    from_now_exact($seconds)
The same as ago(-$seconds), ago(-$seconds, $precision),
ago_exact(- $seconds). For example, from_now(120) is "2
minutes from now".

    later($seconds)
    later($seconds, $precision)
For a positive value of seconds, this prints the same as
`duration($seconds, [$precision]) . ' later''. For example,
ago(120) is "2 minutes later". For a negative value of
seconds, this prints the same as `duration($seconds,
[$precision]) . ' earlier''. For example, later(- 120) is "2
minutes earlier". As a special case, later(0) returns "right
then".

    later_exact($seconds)
Same as later($seconds), except that the returned value is an
exact (unrounded) expression of $seconds.

    earlier($seconds)
    earlier($seconds, $precision)
    earlier_exact($seconds)
The same as later(-$seconds), later(-$seconds, $precision),
later_exact(-$seconds). For example, earlier(120) is "2
minutes earlier".

I18N/L10N NOTES
---------------
Little of the internals of this module are English-specific. See
source and/or contact me if you're interested in making a
localized version for some other language than English.

BACKSTORY
---------
I wrote the basic `ago()' function for use in Infobot
(`http://www.infobot.org'), because I was tired of this sort of
response from the Purl Infobot:

      me> Purl, seen Woozle?
      <Purl> Woozle was last seen on #perl 20 days, 7 hours, 32 minutes
      and 40 seconds ago, saying: Wuzzle!

I figured if it was 20 days ago, I don't care about the
seconds. So once I had written `ago()', I abstracted the code a
bit and got all the other functions.

CAVEAT
------
This module calls a durational "year" an interval of exactly 365
days of exactly 24 hours each, with no provision for leap years or
monkey business with 23/25 hour days (much less leap
seconds!). But since the main work of this module is
approximation, that shouldn't be a great problem for most
purposes.

SEE ALSO
--------
Date::Interval (Perl 5), which is similarly named, but does something
rather different.

*Star Trek: The Next Generation* (1987-1994), where the character
Data would express time durations like "1 year, 20 days, 22 hours,
59 minutes, and 35 seconds" instead of rounding to "1 year and 21
days". This is because no-one ever told him to use Time::Duration.
